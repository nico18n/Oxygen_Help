#Oxygen Basic Compiler
 
Copyright © Charles E V Pegge, 2010-2023

Oxygen Basic (o2H) is a Just-In-Time compiler assembler, deployed in a single DLL that takes source code strings and returns executable binary. It is an extension of the O2 assembler. This implementation can be embedded in any application to provide high performance programmability. The compiler can also generate conventional executables and dynamic link libraries (DLL). 

Oxygen supports Object Oriented Programming with multiple inheritance and also single inheritance modes, more suited to COM. In addition to this O2H supports User-defined operators and operator sets for use with complex numbers, matrices, vectors, sets and other specialised forms. It can also compile & execute strings of source code at run time with its built in compile() function, opening new possibilities for functional programming. 

The built in function set is small. but contains the necessary tools to build class / function libraries to any scale. 

In addition to understanding Basic in the QBasic genre, Oxygen can read sufficient C syntax to deal with most C headers directly, eliminating the need to translate them into Basic.
